<p class="byline">By Maya Murray</p>
	<div id="wrapper">
<p class="intro">Here are the most significant impacts fast fashion has on the planet: - Clothing production has roughly doubled since 2000. The growing market for cheap items and new styles is taking a toll on the environment. ... The equivalent of one garbage truck full of clothes is burned or dumped in a landfill every second.</p>

<p>Fast fashion has a devastating environmental impact. Here are a number of ways the industry damages the planet:</p>

<h2 id=<"FASHION & WATER POLLUTION"> FASHION & WATER POLLUTION</h2>

<p>In most of the countries in which garments are produced, untreated toxic wastewaters from textiles factories are dumped directly into ditches, streams, and rivers.

This toxic water waste is caused by textile dying, and has been discovered to fill up 2 million Olympic-sized swimming pools each year!

Wastewater contains toxic substances such as lead, mercury, and arsenic, and many others. These are extremely harmful to not only aquatic life, but also the health of millions of people living by these sources of water. And of cource these water sources eventually make their way to oceans, thus spreading the harmful waste across the globe.

Another major source of water contamination is the use of fertilizers for cotton production, which heavily pollutes runoff waters and evaporation waters</p>

<h2 id=<"WATER CONSUMPTION OF THE FASHION INDUSTRY"> WATER CONSUMPTION OF THE FASHION INDUSTRY</h2>

<p>The fashion industry is a major water consumer.</p>

<p>A huge quantity of fresh water is used to create our clothes, and
according to a 2017 report issued by the Global Fashion Agenda, the fashion industry consumed nearly 79 billion cubic meters of water â€“ the equivalent of 32 million Olympic-size swimming pools. </p>

<p>When you think of all the people in the world that are bearly surviving and struggling to find water that is safe to drink, it is truly sadening to think that the HUGE percentage of water, that is used to produce clothes that bearly last a year could have been used to save lives instead.</p>

<p>Cotton, which is one of the most commonly used fabrics when it comes to the fast fashion industry. poses a significant threat to health and well-being for agricultural workers, for eco systems and for all of us. This scarce resource needs A LOT of water and heat to grow. And is usually cultivated in warm, dry areas, thus the need for extreme ammounts of water.</p>

<p>20,000 liters of water are needed to produce just 1kg of cotton, which is crazy when there are many other recouces that arent nearly as scarce, need alot less water and heat etc and are much more reliable </p>

<p>There are many darastic ecological consequence that come from this, such as the desertification of the Aral Sea, that has completely drained due to cotton production. (see pictures below)</p>

<p class="intro">85 % of the daily needs in water of the entire population of India would be covered by the water used to grow cotton in the country.
100 million people in India do not have access to drinking water.</p>

<p>Every second, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textile waste is landfilled or burned. 1 truck per second disposed of into the earth that we are struggling to keep alive. Our landfills are overflowing with textile waste, a conservative estimate is that clothing and textiles make up 7% of landfills globally although many believe this figure is closer to 12%. The average U.S. citizen reportedly throws away 70 pounds (31.75kg) of clothing and other textiles each year. </p>

<p>Our desire for new clothes sees more than 100 billion garments produced worldwide each year, more than double what was made in the year 2000. On top of that it is estimated that of the textiles/garments made each year, 85% ends up in landfill or incinerated. So overall we are buying 60% more clothing, but keeping garments for half as long. Its been predicted by Global Fashion Agenda that apparel consumption will rise 63% to 102m tonnes by 2030 if current trends continue. With most of our clothes heading straight to landfill, a 63% rise is a pretty big deal and it's only going to increase if we don't do anything about it.</p>

<p> We tend to just throw out our unwanted garments and forget about them, which is not a great mindset to have, sure it's definitely easy to do, myself and others have definitely done it, but the clothes we throw out to go to landfill in hopes of it breaking down over time does just the opposite. Even if the garment was made out of 100% cotton, it would have a far greater chance at breaking down buried in your backyard then it would surrounded by plastic and other waste.</->

<p> It takes around 30 to 40 years for an average garment to decompose, but in a landfill, the decomposing clothes release methane, a harmful greenhouse gas. And can take hundreds of years to biodegrade.

<p> I'm sure you and the other billions of people had good reason to throw your unwanted garment in the trash rather than donate it. Whether that be due to noticeable stains, rips or it being stretched out etc. but it's for this very same reason that it's best to invest in something that you know isn't going to tear or stretch out within a year, rather than by something on trend that isn't going to last. I know it's easier said than done and i'm definitely guilty of this, but if we all gradually started avoiding the fast fashion labels and instead aim to buy something we know is going to last, is made from recycled fabrics etc. The brands we all know and love will be forced into switching to being more ethical, which will have a huge benefit on us and our planet! Ime not saying stop buying fast fashion, but instead lessen the amount you buy as it make a huge difference.</->

<p>make a headband from an old top, a dogs blanket from an overdue jersey, cleaning cloths from old tees, etc.</p>

<h2 id=<"FASHION & CHEMICALS"> FASHION & CHEMICALS</h2>

<P>Chemicals are one of the main components in our clothes.

They are used during fiber production, dyeing, bleaching, and wet processing of each of our garments.

The heavy use of chemicals in cotton farming is causing diseases and premature death among cotton farmers, along with massive freshwater and ocean water pollution and soil degradation.

Some of these substances are also harmful to the consumer.</->

<P>Microfibres are also a big issue</->

<p>Every time we wash a synthetic garment (polyester,nylon, etc), about 700.000 individual microfibers are released into the water, making their way into our oceans. Scientists have discovered that small aquatic organisms ingest those microfibers. These are then eaten by small fish which are later eaten by bigger fish, introducing plastic in our food chain.</->

<p>According to a recent study one person "could release almost 300 million polyester microfibres per year to the environment by washing their clothes, and more than 900 million to the air by simply wearing the garments".</->

<h2 id=<"FASHION & GREENHOUSE GASES EMISSIONS "> FASHION & GREENHOUSE GASES EMISSIONS </h2>

<p>The apparel industry accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions.

The global fashion industry is generating a lot of greenhouse gases due to the energy used during its production, manufacturing, and transportation of the million garments purchased each year.

Synthetic fibers (polyester, acrylic, nylon, etc.), used in the majority of our clothes, are made from fossil fuel, making production much more energy-intensive than with natural fibers.

Most of our clothes are produced in China, Bangladesh, or India, countries essentially powered by coal. This is the dirtiest type of energy in terms of carbon emissions.

Also, according to James Conca from FORBES: " Cheap synthetic fibers also emit gases like N2O, which is 300 times more damaging than CO2."</->

<h2 id=<"FASHION & RAINFOREST DESTRUCTION"> FASHION & RAINFOREST DESTRUCTION</h2>

<p>Every year, thousands of hectares of endangered and ancient forests are cut down and replaced by plantations of trees used to make wood-based fabrics such as rayon, viscose, and modal.

This loss of forests is threatening the ecosystem and indigenous communities, as in Indonesia where large-scale deforestation of the rainforests has taken place over the past decade.</->


<p class="intro">"150 million trees are logged and turned into fabric every year. If placed end to end, these trees would circle our earth's equator 7 times over. It's a big problem, and with fast fashion increasingly shaping our purchasing behaviours we need big solutions!"</p>
