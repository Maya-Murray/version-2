<p>Fast fashion is the term used to describe clothing designs that move quickly from the catwalk to stores to take advantage of trends. Innovations in supply chain management among retailers make fast fashion possible. Zara and H&M are two giants in the fast fashion field. Others include UNIQLO,GAP, Topshop and many others.</p>

<p> The Oxford definition of Fast Fashion is: </p>

<p>Inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends.</p>

<H2>The issue</H2>

<p>The drop in garment prices over the last 20 years has allowed us to buy more and more clothes. We now have 5 times more clothes than our grandparents had. It felt great until we found out what was hiding behind this trend.

In reality, this continuous accumulation of cheap garments is only possible because of a constant reduction of production costs. This, in turn, has serious consequences on our health, our planet, and on garment workers’ lives.</p>
