<p>Think twice before buying a new item of clothing. Does it spark joy? will you still like it in a year? We tend to buy clothes we tell ourselves we will wear non stop but end up wearing them maybe 5 times times or no times at all. This of course isnt the case for eveybody but it is for a vast majority of people. The average garment is worn around 120 times before it is digarded and that number is decreasing evey year.</p>

<p>A root of the problem lies in our excessive consumerism: we buy 10 while our grandmothers bought 2</p>

<p class="intro">Buy less, choose well, make it last.</p>

<p>More and more fashion brands are beginning to take into account the environmental and social impact of their production. The offer is still limited but I can gaurentee you will find a brand out there that will fit your style, and if not buy second hand ! Go thrift shopping, buy locally, or shop at online resell stores such as ThreadUp, which has a wide range of styles and each garment (they sell jewellery and shoes etc also) is top quality. they even sell luxury pieces for a much lower cost.</p>

<p>A couple other favourites are Depop or Poshmark but there are so many more</p>

<p>It is easier and cheaper to go to the closest shopping center to refill your wardrobe. But the more we demand sustainable clothing, the more will be available- just like organic food was difficult to find 15 years ago. Today, it is available in most supermarkets</p>

<p>- Sustain Your Style</p>

<p> Don't throw out your clothes! they will just pile up in the landfill. Instead try:</p>

<p>- TRY REPAIRING THEM. Beleive it or not sewing can actually become a very fun and almost theraputic thing to do. And its a great opportunuity to re style/re vamp your clothes ! </p>

<p>- DONATE YOUR CLOTHES. To your Family, friends, local charity shop or your neighbors. </p>

<p>- SELL THEM ON RE SELL APPS. Such as Depop, ThreadUp, Poshmark, Vinted and many more !</p>

<p>- PUT THEM IN A TEXTILE RECYCLING BIN. Textiles can be recycled to make new clothing.</p>

<p>Its not new news but buying second hand (AKA Thrifting) is super fun and addictive and you can find all the styles and trends that are current in them because almost every trend comes back in fashion (its like a clothing life cycle). So I can gaurentee you will find soemthing you love ! for example a couple eyars ago the trendy decade of fashion was the 80s, then it was the 90s, and now its the 70's and early 2000's ! and you can find all of these styles in your local thrift. And if you arent a fan of searching amongst rails and rails of clothes, there are other alternatives such as shopping from resell apps as discussed earlier or shopping from curated vintage boutiques which have picked out all the good pieces already.</p>

<p> Swapping and renting clothing for a special event or just for the fun of it is also alot of fun if you only want a garemnt etc for a one off ecasion or if you want to see if you would like something enough to justufy buying it after having it in you possesion for a certain ammount of time.</p>

<P>Washing our clothes has a significant environmental impact. The average household does almost 400 loads of laundry every year, consuming about 60,000 liters of water and many more harmful factors. Here are some helpful tips above ! </P>

<p class="intro">And finally educate your friends, family and those you know on everything you know and have learnt ! it really makes a difference.</p>
