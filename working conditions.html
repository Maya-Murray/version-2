Garment workers are often forced to work 14 to 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. During peak season, they may work until 2 or 3 am to meet the fashion brand's deadline. Their basic wages are so low that they cannot refuse overtime - aside from the fact that many would be fired if they refused to work overtime.</p>

<h2 id="WAGES AND CHILD LABOUR IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY">WAGES AND CHILD LABOUR IN THE FASHION INDUSTRY</h2>


<p>168 million children over the world are forced to work. And because the fashion industry requires low skilled labour, the textiles industry is often where these children opt to work. The industry will often send children, specifically girls from poor families to work for 3 to 5 years in exchange for a basic wage and lump-sum payment, which doesn’t add up to very much considering the amount of work they have to do. As we know it's not just children that work, these textile companies take advantage of the poorer population who have no choice but to work for any salary even if it’s only around 2-6 cents per garment made, whilst working in horrible conditions sometimes working 16 to 18-hour workdays which increase as their companies deadline gets closer. These textile factories aren’t even paying their workers the legal minimum wage salary, furthermore, in most of these manufacturing countries, the minimum wage represents around half to a fifth of a living wage which is the bare minimum a family needs in order to fulfil its basic needs such as food.</p>

<h2 id="HEALTH AND SAFETY CONDITIONS">HEALTH AND SAFETY CONDITIONS</h2>

<p>Employees usually work with no ventilation, breathing in toxic substances, inhaling fibre dust or blasted sand in unsafe buildings. And accidents, fires, injuries, and disease are very frequent occurrences on textile production sites. On top of this, they are often faced with verbal and physical abuse, and if they fail to meet their companies basically unreachable daily deadline, after working from 14 hours upwards, they are then denied water or breaks and faced with more abuse. These factories are also killing the workers due to their unsafe building foundations, in 2013 1134 garment workers were killed after the Rana Plaza factory collapse, which is the risk every single one of these factories is faced with, yet they do nothing to help make these factories a more safe and inviting place to work.</p>
